# Mazeltov
Maze generation and solution using various algorithms.

MAZE-ltov - get it?

Currently supports unbiased depth-first-search, randomized Prim's algorithm, and randomized Kruskal's algorithm for generation of mazes.

#### Notes
* Maximum recommended maze size is 1000 by 750. Any larger than that and it is impossible to distinguish between individual cells. 
* Larger mazes will result in long generation times. Be warned.â€¹
